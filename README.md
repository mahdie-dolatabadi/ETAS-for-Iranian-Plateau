This repository contains the ETAS model implementation for seismic analysis on the Iranian Plateau, utilizing Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) for parameter estimation.
# Overview of the ETAS Model
The Epidemic-Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) model is a widely used framework for understanding and forecasting the temporal and spatial evolution of aftershock sequences following large earthquakes. It builds upon the observation that aftershocks often occur in clusters and are influenced by both the triggering mainshock and previous aftershocks. The model considers the occurrence of aftershocks as a point process, where the likelihood of an aftershock depends on the time since the previous event, as well as the magnitude of the triggering event. The ETAS model is particularly useful for seismic hazard assessment, helping to estimate the aftershock activity following a major earthquake, and provides a foundation for forecasting future seismic events in an area based on historical data.
# Estimation of  Model Parameters Using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)
In the ETAS model, the parameters governing the occurrence of aftershocks—such as the triggering rate, the decay of aftershock frequency over time, and the spatial distribution of aftershocks—are typically estimated using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). MLE is a statistical method used to find the set of parameters that maximize the likelihood of the observed seismic data under the model. By optimizing the likelihood function, MLE allows for precise estimation of the model's parameters, which can then be used to generate forecasts for future aftershock activity.
